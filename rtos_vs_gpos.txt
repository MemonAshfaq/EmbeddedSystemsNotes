RTOS vs GPOS
===========================================================

RTOS (Real-Time Operating System):
- Designed for deterministic behavior (predictable response).
- Focus = meeting deadlines.
- Guarantees bounded interrupt & task switching latency.

GPOS (General Purpose OS):
- Designed for throughput, fairness, multitasking.
- Focus = maximizing resource utilization (CPU, memory, I/O).
- No strict guarantees on response time.

Key Differences:
1. Determinism:
   - RTOS → bounded latency (hard limits).
   - GPOS → best effort, unbounded delays possible.
   
2. Scheduling:
   - RTOS → priority-based preemptive scheduling.
   - GPOS → fairness, time-sharing, CFS (Linux).
   
3. Resources:
   - RTOS → minimal footprint, runs on MCUs.
   - GPOS → larger, runs on powerful CPUs.
   
4. Use cases:
   - RTOS → automotive ECUs, avionics, medical devices, cameras.
   - GPOS → desktops, servers, smartphones.

Hard vs Soft Real-Time:
- Hard RTOS: deadline miss = system failure (airbag ECU, pacemaker).
- Soft RTOS: occasional miss tolerable (multimedia playback).
